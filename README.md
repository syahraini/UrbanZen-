##  Key Findings  

### 1. Delivery Delays Significantly Impact Customer Satisfaction  
Orders delivered on time maintain strong satisfaction scores (4.25/5), while delayed orders show dramatically lower ratings (2.54/5), representing a 40% decline in customer satisfaction.

### 2. Delays Are Substantial in Duration  
The average delay length of 10 days indicates meaningful disruptions to customer expectations, explaining the significant satisfaction drop.

### 3. Performance Issues Are Seller-Driven  
Geographic analysis shows delays are concentrated among specific sellers rather than being tied to particular customer regions, pointing to operational inconsistencies in seller fulfillment.

### 4. Seller Performance Varies Widely  
While the overall delay rate is 9.57%, some sellers exhibit delay rates of 23-24%, indicating specific partners require performance improvement focus.

### 5. Trend Analysis Shows Consistent Patterns  
Historical data reveals persistent delay patterns, suggesting systemic issues rather than one-time occurrences.
